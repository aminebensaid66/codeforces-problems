<h1>Codeforces Solutions Repository</h1>

Welcome to my Codeforces Solutions Repository! This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from Codeforces, a competitive programming platform. Here, you'll find well-documented code that showcases different algorithms and data structures used to solve the problems.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Problem Sets:</strong> Each problem set is organized into directories named after the contest or problem set number.</li>
  <li><strong>Solution Files:</strong> Each directory contains solution files named after the specific problem (e.g., <code>A.cpp</code>, <code>B.cpp</code>, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Comments and Explanations:</strong> Code is well-commented to explain the logic and approach used for solving each problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Use <code>git clone https://github.com/aminebensaid66/codeforces-problems.git</code> to clone the repository.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigate to Problem Directory:</strong> Go to the directory corresponding to the problem set you are interested in.</li>
  <li><strong>Compile and Run:</strong> Compile the solution using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., <code>g++ A.cpp -o A</code>) and run it (e.g., <code>./A</code>).</li>
</ol>
